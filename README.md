# Deep Learning Journey 🧠✨

Welcome to my **Deep Learning** repository!  
This repo is a personal learning archive where I explore deep learning concepts step-by-step — starting from the basics of tensors to building neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 📚🛠️

## 🌱 What You'll Find Here

- **Tensors & Operations**  
  Starting point of my journey — learning how tensors work in PyTorch.

- **Basic Neural Networks**  
  Implemented using PyTorch to understand how models learn from data.  
  **Dataset used**: Iris Dataset [Download here]('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7/raw/0e7a9b0a5d22642a06d3d5b9bcbad9890c8ee534/iris.csv')

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
  Used for image classification tasks — moving from dense layers to spatial learning using kernels.
  used mnist dataset
  Did training and Testing
  explored convulational and pooling layer working

## 🧭 Why I Made This

As a beginner, I found scattered resources hard to follow. By keeping my notebooks organized and progressively structured, this repository serves as:

- My personal reference to track growth and concepts learned.
- A **helpful map for other beginners** — just like these steps helped me, I hope they guide you too.

## 📓 What’s Next?

I’ll continue adding more notebooks as I dive deeper into:
- Transfer Learning
- Custom Datasets
- Deployment
- And more real-world projects...
- I am thinking of working on occcluded objects detection which is the main reason i am learning "deep learning". Will post those notebooks as well:)
